# pricetracker
A price tracker is a tool that allows users to track the prices of specific products or services over time. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

Monitoring price changes: By tracking prices over time, users can see how prices have changed and get a sense of whether they are increasing or decreasing.

Comparison shopping: By comparing prices from different sources, users can find the best deals and save money.

Price forecasting: By analyzing price trends, users can try to predict future price movements and make informed purchasing decisions.

To build a price tracker, you might consider using web scraping techniques to gather data from various online sources, and then storing that data in a database for analysis. You could also build user interfaces for displaying and interacting with the data, such as graphs or tables. Other features you might consider adding include alerts for when prices reach certain thresholds, or the ability to track prices for multiple products at once.
